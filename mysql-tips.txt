MySQL Tips


== Admin

To create a user in MySQL:
  CREATE USER your_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password'

Example:
  CREATE USER yourname@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'

To set password:
  SET PASSWORD FOR 'joe'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpass');

To grant typical development permissions:
  grant all on your_database.* to 'your_user'@'localhost'

To dump schema:
  mysqldump --user=username --password=secret mydatabase --no-data=true --add-drop-table=false > mydatabase_schema.sql
